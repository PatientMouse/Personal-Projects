# Personal Projects

Repository to hold my personal coding projects as a demonstration to employers of skills not used during my education.


# Price Tracker Database Project:

For this weekend project, I build a simple looping database integrated python price database. Its purpose is to give users the ability to store simple prices for an item and be able to view the history of the prices over time. It is built so that one can add any amount more database entries the user would like to track. It is built off of local MySQL server access with root privlages. 

Languages used: Python, MySQL

Themes: Database connection, looped program, Object Oriented data structures


# Prototype Crypto Coin Price Puller Project:

For this unfinished project, I wanted to build a prototype crypto coin price puller that would give me the prices across all markets for a specific coin pair eg: ETH to BTC. I was planning on then using this in a larger FlashLoan project. It is unfinished and unpolished as I abandoned it and realized the project was not where I should be spending my time but was happy with the education on API usage.

Languages used: Python

Themes: API usage
